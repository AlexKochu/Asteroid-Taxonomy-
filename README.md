Asteroid Taxonomy: A Quantitative Analysis of Near-Earth Object Characteristics
Asteroid Taxonomy is an advanced analytical investigation at the convergence of astronomical data and statistical methodology. The project delves into NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset, providing an in-depth exploration of the behaviour, potential threats, and defining characteristics of asteroids that approach Earth's orbit.

Project Overview
This study leverages the NEO dataset to:

Conduct a detailed analysis of critical attributes such as estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital parameters.

Identify significant trends, patterns, and anomalies through thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Assess the potential risks associated with NEOs and extract key insights into their movement and characteristics.

Implement statistical hypothesis testing, including Z-tests and T-tests, to rigorously evaluate hypotheses based on the data.

Data Source
The dataset for this study was sourced from NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs), a comprehensive platform that offers detailed information on asteroids and comets with orbits that intersect Earth’s vicinity.

Tools and Technologies
Python (3.x) — The primary programming language for analysis

Pandas — For data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation

NumPy — For high-level numerical operations and array processing

Matplotlib and Seaborn — For data visualisation and graphical analysis

SciPy and Statsmodels — For statistical modelling and hypothesis testing

Jupyter Notebook — An interactive environment for running and documenting analyses

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Thorough cleaning and preparation of the dataset, including the treatment of missing values and outlier detection, ensuring analytical robustness.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of summary statistics to characterise data distributions, central tendencies, and deviations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive suite of visualisations—such as histograms, scatter plots, kernel density plots, and heatmaps—designed to uncover correlations, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.

Outlier Detection: Identification and analysis of extreme values in asteroid size, velocity, and proximity to Earth, to better understand atypical NEOs.

Statistical Inference: Application of hypothesis testing (Z-tests and T-tests) to validate assumptions regarding the characteristics of NEOs.

Asteroid Classification: Categorisation of NEOs based on key statistical features and orbital parameters, allowing for more precise risk assessment.
