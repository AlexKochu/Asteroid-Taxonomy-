Asteroid Taxonomy: A Data-Intensive Investigation of Near-Earth Object Dynamics
Asteroid Taxonomy is an in-depth analytical study that bridges the disciplines of astronomy and data science. This project systematically analyzes NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to elucidate the behavioral patterns, risk factors, and intrinsic characteristics of asteroids that traverse near Earth's orbital path.

Project Overview
This study was undertaken with the following objectives:

To perform a detailed examination of critical NEO attributes such as estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital elements.

To detect underlying trends, structural patterns, and statistical anomalies through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

To assess the threat levels posed by NEOs and derive data-driven insights into their motion and structural properties.

To apply rigorous statistical inference techniques, including Z-tests and T-tests, for the validation of observational hypotheses.

Data Source
The dataset utilized in this analysis was retrieved from NASA’s Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs). This authoritative source provides an extensive repository of information concerning asteroids and comets whose trajectories bring them into close proximity with Earth.

Key Features
Data Integrity Management: Addressed data inconsistencies and handled missing entries to maintain analytical robustness.

Descriptive Analytics: Computed essential descriptive statistics to summarize and interpret the central tendencies and dispersion within the dataset.

Comprehensive Visual Analysis: Developed a wide array of visualization artifacts, including histograms, scatter plots, kernel density estimates, and correlation heatmaps, to facilitate intuitive data interpretation.

Outlier Identification: Implemented statistical techniques to detect and analyze anomalies across key NEO attributes.

Statistical Hypothesis Testing: Executed formal Z-tests and T-tests to validate assumptions and support data-driven conclusions regarding asteroid characteristics.

NEO Classification Framework: Systematically categorized asteroids based on observed statistical behaviors and orbital features to enhance risk profiling and scientific understanding.
