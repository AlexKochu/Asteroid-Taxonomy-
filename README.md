Asteroid Taxonomy: A Comprehensive Data-Driven Analysis of Near-Earth Objects
Asteroid Taxonomy represents a rigorous exploration at the intersection of space science and statistical data analysis. This project systematically examines NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to investigate the behavioral dynamics, associated risks, and distinguishing characteristics of asteroids that closely approach Earth's orbit.

Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Conduct a detailed analysis of key asteroid attributes, including estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital parameters.

Uncover trends, patterns, and outliers through an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process.

Evaluate the potential hazards posed by NEOs and extract critical insights into their physical and orbital behaviors.

Apply formal hypothesis testing methodologies, including Z-tests and T-tests, to validate statistically significant findings.

Data Source
The dataset employed in this study was sourced from NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs). This platform offers extensive, high-fidelity data on asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them into close proximity with Earth, supporting detailed scientific and statistical investigations.

Tools and Technologies
Python (Version 3.x)

Pandas — For advanced data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy — For efficient numerical computations

Matplotlib and Seaborn — For the creation of detailed visualizations

SciPy and Statsmodels — For conducting hypothesis tests and performing statistical modeling

Jupyter Notebook — For an interactive and modular data analysis environment

Key Features
Robust Data Cleaning: Implemented comprehensive procedures to rectify inconsistencies and manage missing values, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the dataset.

Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Produced summary statistics to capture the central tendencies, variability, and distributional properties of key variables.

Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis: Generated a variety of visualizations—including histograms, scatter plots, kernel density estimations (KDEs), and heatmaps—to systematically identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the data.

Outlier Detection and Analysis: Employed statistical methods to isolate and examine extreme values in asteroid dimensions, velocities, and miss distances.

Hypothesis Testing: Conducted rigorous statistical testing using Z-tests and T-tests to substantiate or refute hypotheses related to NEO characteristics.

Asteroid Classification: Categorized Near-Earth Objects based on statistical behaviors and orbital attributes, providing a structured understanding of their potential impact profiles.
