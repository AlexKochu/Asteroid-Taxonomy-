Asteroid Taxonomy is a data-driven exploration where space science meets statistical analysis. This project focuses on NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to investigate the behaviors, potential risks, and defining characteristics of asteroids that approach Earth's vicinity.

Project Overview
This project utilizes the NASA NEO dataset to:

Analyze critical features such as estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital elements.

Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Assess the potential risks associated with NEOs and derive meaningful insights into their behavior.

Perform hypothesis testing, including Z-tests and T-tests, for deeper statistical evaluation.

Data Source
The dataset was obtained from NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs), which provides comprehensive information about asteroids and comets with orbits that bring them close to Earth.

Tools and Technologies
Python (3.x)

Pandas — Data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy — Numerical computations

Matplotlib and Seaborn — Data visualization

SciPy and Statsmodels — Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis

Jupyter Notebook — Interactive environment for data analysis

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies and handled missing values to ensure data quality.

Descriptive Analytics: Generated summary statistics to understand data distribution and central tendencies.

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis: Developed visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, kernel density estimates (KDEs), and heatmaps to uncover relationships and trends.

Outlier Detection: Identified anomalies in asteroid size, velocity, and proximity to Earth.

Statistical Testing: Conducted Z-tests and T-tests to validate hypotheses regarding asteroid characteristics.

Asteroid Classification: Grouped NEOs based on statistical patterns and orbital features.
