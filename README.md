Asteroid Taxonomy: A Data-Driven Study of Near-Earth Object Dynamics
Asteroid Taxonomy is a comprehensive analytical project situated at the intersection of space science and data analytics. This study systematically investigates NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to understand the behavioural patterns, associated risks, and defining characteristics of asteroids that pass close to Earth's orbital trajectory.

Project Overview
The principal aims of this project are:

To conduct an in-depth analysis of key attributes, including estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital parameters.

To uncover trends, structural patterns, and anomalies through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

To assess potential risks posed by NEOs and derive substantive insights into their physical and orbital behaviours.

To apply robust statistical methodologies, such as Z-tests and T-tests, to validate data-driven hypotheses.

Data Source
The dataset was sourced from NASA’s Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs), an official repository providing detailed information on asteroids and comets whose orbital paths bring them into proximity with Earth.

Tools and Technologies
Python (3.x) — Primary programming environment

Pandas — Advanced data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy — Numerical computations and mathematical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn — Graphical and statistical data visualisation

SciPy and Statsmodels — Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

Jupyter Notebook — Interactive environment for exploratory programming and analysis

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Integrity Assurance: Resolved inconsistencies and addressed missing values to ensure the reliability of the dataset.

Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Generated comprehensive summary statistics to elucidate distributions, central tendencies, and variances within the data.

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis: Produced a series of sophisticated visualisations, including histograms, scatter plots, kernel density estimations, and correlation heatmaps, to reveal underlying patterns and relationships.

Outlier Detection and Analysis: Identified and examined anomalous data points in asteroid size, velocity, and approach distance.

Formal Hypothesis Testing: Conducted statistical tests (Z-tests and T-tests) to confirm or refute hypotheses concerning the properties of NEOs.

Asteroid Classification Scheme: Categorised Near-Earth Objects based on statistical attributes and orbital dynamics to facilitate structured risk assessment and scientific interpretation.
