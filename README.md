# 🚀 Asteroid Taxonomy: Unveiling the Dynamics of Near-Earth Objects

Welcome to **Asteroid Taxonomy** — a deep dive into real space data where data science meets astronomy. In this project, I explored NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset to better understand the behavior, risks, and characteristics of asteroids that venture uncomfortably close to Earth.

## 🌌 Project Overview

This project leverages NASA's NEO dataset to:
- Analyze critical attributes like estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and orbital elements.
- Identify trends, patterns, and outliers using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Evaluate potential risks of NEOs and reveal meaningful insights into their behavior.
- Perform hypothesis testing (Z-test, T-test) for deeper statistical insights.

## 🔍 Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)](https://api.nasa.gov/), which provides detailed information on asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth's orbit.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (3.x)
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **SciPy/Statsmodels** – Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ **Robust Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and null values to preserve data integrity.
- ✅ **Descriptive Analytics**: Summary statistics to understand distribution and central tendencies.
- ✅ **Visual EDA**: Insightful plots (histograms, scatterplots, KDEs, heatmaps) to detect correlations and trends.
- ✅ **Outlier Detection**: Pinpointed anomalies in asteroid size, speed, and distance.
- ✅ **Statistical Testing**: Applied Z-tests and T-tests to test hypotheses on asteroid characteristics.
- ✅ **Asteroid Classification**: Grouped NEOs based on statistical behavior and orbital features.
